TODO:
- Enemy - Ippondatara (programming done)
- Village => building + background trees + yokai residents (rural)
- Nozuchi art rework (maybe color scheme change or make it more furry)
- Area needs more uniqueness (background or add points of interests)
- Changing aggro checks to using raycast


TODO animations:
- Run_Left Animation
- Attack left animation
- Attack while running animation
- no swords in falling or jumping animation

Bug:
- able to start dialogue when paused
- Infinite money bug: Instead of completely hitting the treasure, hit until 1 hit left, then re-enter the area to have all hits again
- Nozuchi may sink into the ground when stepped on
- enemy drops clip into ground

Performance Issue in Build:
- may have issue with Vsync, build is slower than in Editor (setting vsync to "Don't Count" fix this, but mess up vcam)

Gameplay Improvements needed:
- Camera deadzones tweaks
- Tweak jumping - hovering a bit at peak height
- Sliding when taking damage (cuz using AddForce)

Environment improvements (?):
- use sprite instead of 2D lights for more control?

Programming Improvements needed: (search TODO)
- Save Point Scene Script uses prevScene == "_Preload" instead of "Main_Menu" (_Preload is loaded for a frame for some reason)
- Save Point Scene Script load twice (once in MainMenu, once Save Point Scene Script again)


World:
- Areas should fit a virtue theme (e.g. patience, forgiveness)
