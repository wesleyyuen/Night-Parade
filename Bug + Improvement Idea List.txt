TODO:
- Changing textbox to semicricle (botw)
- Village => building + background trees + yokai residents (rural)
- Design Forest, points of interests
- Nozuchi art rework (maybe color scheme change or make it more furry) + one more move  (related to/compliment dash)
- implement blocking? (Iron-related item? increase mass i.e. fall faster + jump lower)


TODO animations:
- Run_Left Animation
- Attack left animation
- Attack while running animation
- no swords in falling or jumping animation

Bug:
- enemies cannot patrol on some platform (will just turn around repeatedly in place)
- able to start dialogue when paused
- player animation bugs out when walking down slopes
- Nozuchi may sink into the ground when stepped on
- enemy drops clip into ground
- Infinite money bug: Instead of completely hitting the treasure, hit until 1 hit left, then re-enter the area to have all hits again

Maybe:
- Look into movement

Play mode bugs:
- Player shaking

Event Ideas:
- Ubasute (姥捨て) => 1st see both in village , son unwilling; 2nd see son carrying mom up mountain; 3rd see corpse of mom + son back to village


Performance Issue in Build:
- may have issue with Vsync, build is slower than in Editor (setting vsync to "Don't Count" fix this, but mess up vcam)

Gameplay Improvements needed:
- Camera deadzones tweaks

Environment improvements (?):
- use sprite instead of 2D lights for more control?

Programming Improvements needed: (search TODO)
- Save Point Scene Script uses prevScene == "_Preload" instead of "Main_Menu" (_Preload is loaded for a frame for some reason)
- Save Point Scene Script load twice (once in MainMenu, once Save Point Scene Script again)


World:
- Areas should fit a virtue theme (e.g. patience, forgiveness)

Boss / Enemies Ideas:
- Daruma
- Stack Doll
